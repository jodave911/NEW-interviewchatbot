**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",

}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Can you walk me through your most recent role and explain how the responsibilities you handled there might translate to the cashier position at Eco Market?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Hey

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**

    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",

}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.

* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.

* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
I appreciate your brief response. To get a clearer picture of your hands‑on experience, could you describe a specific time when you had to double‑check a recipe or portion size for a resident with a dietary restriction (e.g., low‑sodium, diabetic, pureed diet)? Please walk me through the exact steps you took—from recognizing the need, verifying measurements, consulting any resources, to confirming the resident’s needs were met.

**Candidate's Answer:**
mp

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Thank you for your response. To get a clearer picture of your hands‑on experience, could you tell me about a specific resident you cared for who had a dietary restriction (e.g., low‑sodium, diabetic, pureed diet)? Please describe the exact moment you realized you needed to double‑check the recipe or portion size, the precise measurements you verified (e.g., sodium content, carbohydrate count, texture specifications), any resources (nutrition guides, dietitian, kitchen staff) or colleagues you consulted, and how you confirmed that the resident’s dietary needs were fully met and documented.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

**Current State Analysis:**
* **Current Topic:** Relevant Experience
* **History:** Bot: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your background and experience as they relate to the role. Let's begin.
Bot: Can you walk me through your most recent role and explain how the skills you developed there could translate to a cashier position at Eco Market?
User: In my most recent role, I worked on creative and technical projects that required strong attention to detail, organization, and customer interaction. I frequently managed multiple tasks at once—such as coordinating shoots, handling payments, and ensuring client satisfaction—which helped me develop time management and communication skills. I also gained experience working under pressure and maintaining accuracy, both of which are essential for handling cash transactions efficiently. Additionally, I became comfortable using digital tools and maintaining records, which translates well to managing point-of-sale systems and inventory tracking. Most importantly, my experience taught me the value of creating a positive and friendly customer experience—something I believe aligns perfectly with Eco Market’s focus on community and sustainability.
Bot: Thanks for the overview. Could you walk me through a specific instance from your last role where you had to handle a cash transaction or resolve a customer issue while juggling multiple tasks (e.g., coordinating a shoot and processing payments)? Please describe the situation, the actions you took, and the result.
User: Sure! During one of my video projects, I was coordinating a shoot for a client who wanted same-day edits and quick delivery. While managing the filming schedule and directing the team, the client also requested to make a last-minute payment in cash. At that moment, I had to balance staying focused on the shoot while ensuring the transaction was handled properly. I quickly delegated camera setup tasks to my assistant, confirmed the payment amount, issued a handwritten receipt, and safely stored the cash before returning to the shoot. Later, I recorded the transaction digitally for accurate tracking. By staying calm and organized, I ensured the client felt confident in the process and the project stayed on schedule. The client appreciated the professionalism and timely delivery, which led to a referral for another project.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Thank you for that example. Can you tell me about a time when a customer was unhappy or dissatisfied—perhaps with a product or service—and how you handled the situation while still maintaining your other responsibilities?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Of course. Once, a client was unhappy with the initial edit of a promotional video I delivered, saying it didn’t fully capture the tone they wanted. At the time, I was also managing another ongoing project, so balancing both was challenging. I first listened carefully to their feedback to understand what they were expecting. Instead of getting defensive, I reassured them that I’d make the necessary adjustments. I then scheduled time later that day to re-edit the footage—focusing on pacing, color tone, and music—to better match their vision. While waiting for the updated files to render, I continued coordinating tasks for my other project to stay on track. The revised video met their expectations, and they later commended the quick turnaround and professionalism. That experience taught me how important patience, clear communication, and adaptability are in keeping customers satisfied even under pressure.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"

**Original Question:**
Thanks for that overview. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a concrete instance when you balanced a cash drawer at a specific job (e.g., a retail store, restaurant, or similar), including the exact amount of the discrepancy, how you discovered it, who you informed, how you corrected it while still handling other duties, and what the outcome was?

**Candidate's Answer:**
I actually worked in a traditional retail or restaurant setting where I handled a formal cash drawer, but I can share a closely related experience from my freelance work that required similar accountability. While managing client payments for a weekend event shoot, I noticed a ₹500 discrepancy between the recorded payments and the cash on hand at the end of the day. I immediately double-checked my handwritten receipts and digital notes while still overseeing file transfers and equipment packing. I discovered that one partial payment had been mistakenly logged as full. I contacted the client to confirm, updated my records, and adjusted the total. I then reported the correction to my supervisor on the project and finalized the accounts accurately. This experience strengthened my attention to detail and taught me how to stay calm, transparent, and efficient while managing financial accuracy alongside other responsibilities.

  "history": "Bot: Thanks for the overview. Could you walk me through a specific instance from your last role where you had to handle a cash transaction or resolve a customer issue while juggling multiple tasks (e.g., coordinating a shoot and processing payments)? Please describe the situation, the actions you took, and the result.\nUser: Sure! During one of my video projects, I was coordinating a shoot for a client who wanted same-day edits and quick delivery. While managing the filming schedule and directing the team, the client also requested to make a last-minute payment in cash. At that moment, I had to balance staying focused on the shoot while ensuring the transaction was handled properly. I quickly delegated camera setup tasks to my assistant, confirmed the payment amount, issued a handwritten receipt, and safely stored the cash before returning to the shoot. Later, I recorded the transaction digitally for accurate tracking. By staying calm and organized, I ensured the client felt confident in the process and the project stayed on schedule. The client appreciated the professionalism and timely delivery, which led to a referral for another project.\nBot: Thank you for that example. Can you tell me about a time when a customer was unhappy or dissatisfied\u2014perhaps with a product or service\u2014and how you handled the situation while still maintaining your other responsibilities?\nUser: Of course. Once, a client was unhappy with the initial edit of a promotional video I delivered, saying it didn\u2019t fully capture the tone they wanted. At the time, I was also managing another ongoing project, so balancing both was challenging. I first listened carefully to their feedback to understand what they were expecting. Instead of getting defensive, I reassured them that I\u2019d make the necessary adjustments. I then scheduled time later that day to re-edit the footage\u2014focusing on pacing, color tone, and music\u2014to better match their vision. While waiting for the updated files to render, I continued coordinating tasks for my other project to stay on track. The revised video met their expectations, and they later commended the quick turnaround and professionalism. That experience taught me how important patience, clear communication, and adaptability are in keeping customers satisfied even under pressure.\nBot: Thanks for sharing that example. Can you walk me through a specific time when you had to balance a cash drawer at the end of a shift or day, discovered a discrepancy, and how you resolved it while still managing your other responsibilities?\nUser: Sure!

On one occasion, while reconciling payments at the end of the day, I noticed that the total cash didn\u2019t match the recorded amount\u2014there was a small shortfall. Instead of panicking, I paused my ongoing editing work and carefully rechecked each receipt, payment entry, and expense. I realized one transaction had been recorded twice digitally but paid only once in cash. I immediately corrected the entry, updated the log, and verified the new total matched the cash on hand. After resolving it, I created a simple checklist system for future transactions to avoid similar mistakes. This experience taught me the importance of accuracy, accountability, and keeping calm under pressure\u2014skills that directly apply to balancing a cash drawer and maintaining financial integrity in a cashier role.\nBot: Thanks for that overview.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

While managing client payments for a weekend event shoot, I noticed a ₹500 discrepancy between the recorded payments and the cash on hand at the end of the day. I immediately double-checked my handwritten receipts and digital notes while still overseeing file transfers and equipment packing. I discovered that one partial payment had been mistakenly logged as full. I contacted the client to confirm, updated my records, and adjusted the total. I then reported the correction to my supervisor on the project and finalized the accounts accurately. This experience strengthened my attention to detail and taught me how to stay calm, transparent, and efficient while managing financial accuracy alongside other responsibilities.
Bot: Thank you for sharing that example. To get a clearer picture of your experience with cash‑drawer responsibilities, could you walk me through a specific time you balanced a cash drawer at a retail store, restaurant, or similar venue? Please include the exact amount of any discrepancy you found, how you discovered it, who you reported it to, the steps you took to resolve it while still managing your other duties, and what the final outcome was.
User: While working at a local café, I was responsible for balancing the cash drawer at the end of each shift. One evening, I noticed a ₹200 shortfall while counting the till. I calmly reviewed each transaction receipt, compared the sales report from the POS system, and double-checked cash entries. While doing this, I also continued assisting the closing team with restocking and cleaning to stay on schedule. After carefully reviewing the records, I discovered that a ₹200 cash payment had been mistakenly entered as card payment. I immediately reported the issue to the shift supervisor, explained the situation, and corrected the entry in the system with approval. Once fixed, the cash drawer balanced perfectly. The supervisor appreciated my honesty and attention to detail. From that experience, I learned the importance of staying organized, double-checking records, and communicating clearly—even when multitasking under end-of-shift pressure.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Great, thank you for that detailed cash‑drawer example. Shifting focus a bit, can you tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult or dissatisfied customer at the checkout while still processing their transaction quickly and accurately? What steps did you take to resolve the issue and keep the line moving?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Sure! While working at the café, a customer became upset when a discount they expected didn’t apply at checkout. There was a long line forming, so I stayed calm and friendly while quickly checking the promotion details on the POS system. I realized the offer had expired the previous day, but instead of saying “no” outright, I explained the situation politely and offered an alternative combo deal that gave a similar value. While processing their order, I kept the conversation positive and efficient so the next customers weren’t delayed. The customer appreciated the effort and agreed to the new offer. I completed their transaction accurately, issued the correct change, and kept the line moving smoothly. Afterward, my supervisor thanked me for handling the situation professionally. That moment taught me how to stay composed, think fast, and maintain good customer flow even under pressure.

**Analysis Task:**

3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.

**Current State Analysis:**
* **Current Topic:** Customer Service and POS Interaction
* **History:** Bot: Thanks for sharing that example. Can you walk me through a specific time when you had to balance a cash drawer at the end of a shift or day, discovered a discrepancy, and how you resolved it while still managing your other responsibilities?
User: Sure! During one of my freelance projects, I occasionally handled both creative work and cash payments from clients. On one occasion, while reconciling payments at the end of the day, I noticed that the total cash didn’t match the recorded amount—there was a small shortfall. Instead of panicking, I paused my ongoing editing work and carefully rechecked each receipt, payment entry, and expense. I realized one transaction had been recorded twice digitally but paid only once in cash. I immediately corrected the entry, updated the log, and verified the new total matched the cash on hand. After resolving it, I created a simple checklist system for future transactions to avoid similar mistakes. This experience taught me the importance of accuracy, accountability, and keeping calm under pressure—skills that directly apply to balancing a cash drawer and maintaining financial integrity in a cashier role.
Bot: Thanks for that overview. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a concrete instance when you balanced a cash drawer at a specific job (e.g., a retail store, restaurant, or similar), including the exact amount of the discrepancy, how you discovered it, who you informed, how you corrected it while still handling other duties, and what the outcome was?
User: I actually worked in a traditional retail or restaurant setting where I handled a formal cash drawer, but I can share a closely related experience from my freelance work that required similar accountability. While managing client payments for a weekend event shoot, I noticed a ₹500 discrepancy between the recorded payments and the cash on hand at the end of the day. I immediately double-checked my handwritten receipts and digital notes while still overseeing file transfers and equipment packing. I discovered that one partial payment had been mistakenly logged as full. I contacted the client to confirm, updated my records, and adjusted the total. I then reported the correction to my supervisor on the project and finalized the accounts accurately. This experience strengthened my attention to detail and taught me how to stay calm, transparent, and efficient while managing financial accuracy alongside other responsibilities.
Bot: Thank you for sharing that example. To get a clearer picture of your experience with cash‑drawer responsibilities, could you walk me through a specific time you balanced a cash drawer at a retail store, restaurant, or similar venue? Please include the exact amount of any discrepancy you found, how you discovered it, who you reported it to, the steps you took to resolve it while still managing your other duties, and what the final outcome was.
User: While working at a local café, I was responsible for balancing the cash drawer at the end of each shift. One evening, I noticed a ₹200 shortfall while counting the till. I calmly reviewed each transaction receipt, compared the sales report from the POS system, and double-checked cash entries. While doing this, I also continued assisting the closing team with restocking and cleaning to stay on schedule. After carefully reviewing the records, I discovered that a ₹200 cash payment had been mistakenly entered as card payment. I immediately reported the issue to the shift supervisor, explained the situation, and corrected the entry in the system with approval. Once fixed, the cash drawer balanced perfectly. The supervisor appreciated my honesty and attention to detail. From that experience, I learned the importance of staying organized, double-checking records, and communicating clearly—even when multitasking under end-of-shift pressure.
Bot: Great, thank you for that detailed cash‑drawer example. Shifting focus a bit, can you tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult or dissatisfied customer at the checkout while still processing their transaction quickly and accurately? What steps did you take to resolve the issue and keep the line moving?
User: Sure! While working at the café, a customer became upset when a discount they expected didn’t apply at checkout. There was a long line forming, so I stayed calm and friendly while quickly checking the promotion details on the POS system. I realized the offer had expired the previous day, but instead of saying “no” outright, I explained the situation politely and offered an alternative combo deal that gave a similar value. While processing their order, I kept the conversation positive and efficient so the next customers weren’t delayed. The customer appreciated the effort and agreed to the new offer. I completed their transaction accurately, issued the correct change, and kept the line moving smoothly. Afterward, my supervisor thanked me for handling the situation professionally. That moment taught me how to stay composed, think fast, and maintain good customer flow even under pressure.
Bot: Thanks for sharing that example. To get a clearer picture of your hands‑on experience, could you walk me through the exact moment the customer raised the issue—what specific discount were they expecting, what exact wording did you use to explain the expiration, how did you manage the line while you were negotiating the alternative combo, and what was the final outcome (e.g., time saved, any feedback from the customer or manager)?
User: Of course! One busy afternoon at the café, a customer at checkout questioned why their “Buy 1 Get 1 Free on Iced Lattes” discount hadn’t applied. They seemed frustrated, saying, “It worked yesterday—why not today?” With a growing line behind them, I smiled and said, “I completely understand—that offer was really popular! It actually ended last night, but let me check what I can do for you.” As I confirmed the promo’s expiration on the POS, I kept the line moving by greeting the next customers and asking them to have their orders ready. I then offered the customer our new combo deal—₹20 off any two drinks—which I applied immediately to keep the transaction quick. They appreciated the gesture, saying, “Thanks for checking, that’s fair.” The whole exchange took under two minutes, and my manager later mentioned that my calm tone and efficiency helped maintain a positive atmosphere during a busy rush.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Can you share a specific example of a time you helped a customer choose a product—perhaps a healthy or sustainable option—by explaining its benefits and addressing any concerns, while still keeping the checkout process efficient?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Sure! One afternoon at the café, a customer was deciding between a regular pastry and a new vegan oat muffin. They asked if the vegan option actually tasted good and was worth the price. I smiled and said, “It’s one of our best-sellers—made with oats and coconut sugar, so it’s lighter and keeps you full longer. Plus, it’s dairy-free, so it’s a great choice if you’re trying to eat cleaner.” As I explained, I scanned their drink and started preparing the total to keep the checkout moving smoothly. The customer decided to try the muffin, and after tasting it, they said, “You were right—this is great!” Later, my manager mentioned they came back the next day asking for it again. That experience taught me how small, informative conversations can guide customers toward better choices while maintaining speed and friendliness at the counter.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:

    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",

To get a clearer picture of your experience with cash‑drawer responsibilities, could you walk me through a specific time you balanced a cash drawer at a retail store, restaurant, or similar venue? Please include the exact amount of any discrepancy you found, how you discovered it, who you reported it to, the steps you took to resolve it while still managing your other duties, and what the final outcome was.
User: While working at a local café, I was responsible for balancing the cash drawer at the end of each shift. One evening, I noticed a ₹200 shortfall while counting the till. I calmly reviewed each transaction receipt, compared the sales report from the POS system, and double-checked cash entries. While doing this, I also continued assisting the closing team with restocking and cleaning to stay on schedule. After carefully reviewing the records, I discovered that a ₹200 cash payment had been mistakenly entered as card payment. I immediately reported the issue to the shift supervisor, explained the situation, and corrected the entry in the system with approval. Once fixed, the cash drawer balanced perfectly. The supervisor appreciated my honesty and attention to detail. From that experience, I learned the importance of staying organized, double-checking records, and communicating clearly—even when multitasking under end-of-shift pressure.
Bot: Great, thank you for that detailed cash‑drawer example. Shifting focus a bit, can you tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult or dissatisfied customer at the checkout while still processing their transaction quickly and accurately? What steps did you take to resolve the issue and keep the line moving?
User: Sure! While working at the café, a customer became upset when a discount they expected didn’t apply at checkout. There was a long line forming, so I stayed calm and friendly while quickly checking the promotion details on the POS system. I realized the offer had expired the previous day, but instead of saying “no” outright, I explained the situation politely and offered an alternative combo deal that gave a similar value. While processing their order, I kept the conversation positive and efficient so the next customers weren’t delayed. The customer appreciated the effort and agreed to the new offer. I completed their transaction accurately, issued the correct change, and kept the line moving smoothly. Afterward, my supervisor thanked me for handling the situation professionally. That moment taught me how to stay composed, think fast, and maintain good customer flow even under pressure.
Bot: Thanks for sharing that example. To get a clearer picture of your hands‑on experience, could you walk me through the exact moment the customer raised the issue—what specific discount were they expecting, what exact wording did you use to explain the expiration, how did you manage the line while you were negotiating the alternative combo, and what was the final outcome (e.g., time saved, any feedback from the customer or manager)?
User: Of course! One busy afternoon at the café, a customer at checkout questioned why their “Buy 1 Get 1 Free on Iced Lattes” discount hadn’t applied. They seemed frustrated, saying, “It worked yesterday—why not today?” With a growing line behind them, I smiled and said, “I completely understand—that offer was really popular! It actually ended last night, but let me check what I can do for you.” As I confirmed the promo’s expiration on the POS, I kept the line moving by greeting the next customers and asking them to have their orders ready. I then offered the customer our new combo deal—₹20 off any two drinks—which I applied immediately to keep the transaction quick. They appreciated the gesture, saying, “Thanks for checking, that’s fair.” The whole exchange took under two minutes, and my manager later mentioned that my calm tone and efficiency helped maintain a positive atmosphere during a busy rush.
Bot: Can you share a specific example of a time you helped a customer choose a product—perhaps a healthy or sustainable option—by explaining its benefits and addressing any concerns, while still keeping the checkout process efficient?
User: Sure! One afternoon at the café, a customer was deciding between a regular pastry and a new vegan oat muffin. They asked if the vegan option actually tasted good and was worth the price. I smiled and said, “It’s one of our best-sellers—made with oats and coconut sugar, so it’s lighter and keeps you full longer. Plus, it’s dairy-free, so it’s a great choice if you’re trying to eat cleaner.” As I explained, I scanned their drink and started preparing the total to keep the checkout moving smoothly. The customer decided to try the muffin, and after tasting it, they said, “You were right—this is great!” Later, my manager mentioned they came back the next day asking for it again. That experience taught me how small, informative conversations can guide customers toward better choices while maintaining speed and friendliness at the counter.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

They appreciated the gesture, saying, “Thanks for checking, that’s fair.” The whole exchange took under two minutes, and my manager later mentioned that my calm tone and efficiency helped maintain a positive atmosphere during a busy rush.
Bot: Can you share a specific example of a time you helped a customer choose a product—perhaps a healthy or sustainable option—by explaining its benefits and addressing any concerns, while still keeping the checkout process efficient?
User: Sure! One afternoon at the café, a customer was deciding between a regular pastry and a new vegan oat muffin. They asked if the vegan option actually tasted good and was worth the price. I smiled and said, “It’s one of our best-sellers—made with oats and coconut sugar, so it’s lighter and keeps you full longer. Plus, it’s dairy-free, so it’s a great choice if you’re trying to eat cleaner.” As I explained, I scanned their drink and started preparing the total to keep the checkout moving smoothly. The customer decided to try the muffin, and after tasting it, they said, “You were right—this is great!” Later, my manager mentioned they came back the next day asking for it again. That experience taught me how small, informative conversations can guide customers toward better choices while maintaining speed and friendliness at the counter.
Bot: Can you tell me about a time you helped manage inventory for sustainable or eco‑friendly products—how you ensured stock levels were accurate, dealt with any discrepancies, and communicated with the team while maintaining a smooth checkout experience?
User: Absolutely! While working at the café, we introduced a line of eco-friendly products, including reusable cups and organic snacks. I was responsible for monitoring their stock levels daily. One afternoon, while checking inventory, I noticed that the recorded quantity of reusable cups didn’t match what was actually on the shelf—a discrepancy of 5 units. I immediately recounted, updated the inventory log, and informed my supervisor. To prevent future errors, I implemented a simple labeling system and made sure the team knew to update the log whenever items were sold or restocked. While handling this, I also managed the checkout, scanning items efficiently and answering customer questions about the eco-friendly products. By coordinating inventory checks with daily sales, we avoided stockouts, kept customers informed, and maintained a smooth checkout experience. My supervisor later noted that my attention to detail helped the team stay organized and keep sales flowing seamlessly.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Can you describe a time when you proactively promoted an eco‑friendly product to a customer at checkout—how you presented its benefits, handled any objections, and what the outcome was in terms of the sale or customer feedback?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Certainly! While working at the café, I noticed a customer buying a regular takeaway cup and a smoothie. I took the opportunity to mention our reusable bamboo cup, saying, “If you get this cup, you can use it for any drink here and get ₹10 off each refill. It’s durable, eco-friendly, and helps reduce single-use waste.” The customer hesitated, concerned about the initial cost. I acknowledged their concern and added, “Think of it as an investment—you’ll save money over time, and it’s better for the environment.” I quickly scanned their order while explaining so the line kept moving. They decided to purchase the bamboo cup and thanked me for the suggestion. A week later, my manager mentioned that several customers had asked about the cups, showing that proactive, informative promotion not only led to immediate sales but also increased awareness and interest in sustainable options.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Can you describe a situation where you had to reconcile the cash drawer at the end of a shift, discovered a discrepancy, and what steps you took to investigate and resolve it while ensuring the checkout area stayed operational?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Certainly! While working at a busy café, I was reconciling the cash drawer at the end of a shift and noticed a ₹300 discrepancy—the total cash was short compared to the day’s sales report. To investigate without disrupting the checkout area, I first double-checked each transaction receipt against the POS records while still keeping the counter staffed. I discovered that one cash payment had been accidentally logged as card payment. I immediately corrected the entry in the system and updated the cash log, then informed the shift supervisor of the adjustment. Meanwhile, I continued assisting any remaining customers quickly to ensure the checkout area stayed operational. After resolving the issue, the drawer balanced perfectly. This experience reinforced the importance of accuracy, calm problem-solving, and multitasking under pressure—skills directly applicable to maintaining a reliable and efficient checkout process in a retail setting.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

To get a clearer picture of your hands\u2011on experience, could you walk me through the exact moment the customer raised the issue\u2014what specific discount were they expecting, what exact wording did you use to explain the expiration, how did you manage the line while you were negotiating the alternative combo, and what was the final outcome (e.g., time saved, any feedback from the customer or manager)?\nUser: Of course! One busy afternoon at the caf\u00e9, a customer at checkout questioned why their \u201cBuy 1 Get 1 Free on Iced Lattes\u201d discount hadn\u2019t applied. They seemed frustrated, saying, \u201cIt worked yesterday\u2014why not today?\u201d With a growing line behind them, I smiled and said, \u201cI completely understand\u2014that offer was really popular! It actually ended last night, but let me check what I can do for you.\u201d As I confirmed the promo\u2019s expiration on the POS, I kept the line moving by greeting the next customers and asking them to have their orders ready. I then offered the customer our new combo deal\u2014\u20b920 off any two drinks\u2014which I applied immediately to keep the transaction quick.

One afternoon at the caf\u00e9, a customer was deciding between a regular pastry and a new vegan oat muffin. They asked if the vegan option actually tasted good and was worth the price. I smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of our best-sellers\u2014made with oats and coconut sugar, so it\u2019s lighter and keeps you full longer. Plus, it\u2019s dairy-free, so it\u2019s a great choice if you\u2019re trying to eat cleaner.\u201d As I explained, I scanned their drink and started preparing the total to keep the checkout moving smoothly. The customer decided to try the muffin, and after tasting it, they said, \u201cYou were right\u2014this is great!\u201d Later, my manager mentioned they came back the next day asking for it again. That experience taught me how small, informative conversations can guide customers toward better choices while maintaining speed and friendliness at the counter.\nBot: Can you tell me about a time you helped manage inventory for sustainable or eco\u2011friendly products\u2014how you ensured stock levels were accurate, dealt with any discrepancies, and communicated with the team while maintaining a smooth checkout experience?\nUser: Absolutely! While working at the caf\u00e9, we introduced a line of eco-friendly products, including reusable cups and organic snacks. I was responsible for monitoring their stock levels daily. One afternoon, while checking inventory, I noticed that the recorded quantity of reusable cups didn\u2019t match what was actually on the shelf\u2014a discrepancy of 5 units. I immediately recounted, updated the inventory log, and informed my supervisor. To prevent future errors, I implemented a simple labeling system and made sure the team knew to update the log whenever items were sold or restocked. While handling this, I also managed the checkout, scanning items efficiently and answering customer questions about the eco-friendly products.

While working at the caf\u00e9, I noticed a customer buying a regular takeaway cup and a smoothie. I took the opportunity to mention our reusable bamboo cup, saying, \u201cIf you get this cup, you can use it for any drink here and get \u20b910 off each refill. It\u2019s durable, eco-friendly, and helps reduce single-use waste.\u201d The customer hesitated, concerned about the initial cost. I acknowledged their concern and added, \u201cThink of it as an investment\u2014you\u2019ll save money over time, and it\u2019s better for the environment.\u201d I quickly scanned their order while explaining so the line kept moving.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

I discovered that one cash payment had been accidentally logged as card payment. I immediately corrected the entry in the system and updated the cash log, then informed the shift supervisor of the adjustment.

First, I introduced a double-check routine: every cash payment was logged in the POS system immediately and verified against a quick handwritten note. Second, I briefed the team on the importance of updating the system in real time, so no payments were accidentally recorded incorrectly. Third, I created a simple end-of-shift checklist that included counting cash, verifying receipts against the POS report, and confirming any adjustments with the shift supervisor before closing the drawer.

For example, how did you adjust your cash‑handling routine, team training, or POS verification steps, and what impact did those changes have?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Yes! After resolving the ₹300 shortfall, I implemented a few practical steps to prevent similar discrepancies. First, I introduced a double-check routine: every cash payment was logged in the POS system immediately and verified against a quick handwritten note. Second, I briefed the team on the importance of updating the system in real time, so no payments were accidentally recorded incorrectly. Third, I created a simple end-of-shift checklist that included counting cash, verifying receipts against the POS report, and confirming any adjustments with the shift supervisor before closing the drawer. These small changes made a noticeable difference—subsequent shifts balanced consistently, and team members became more confident handling transactions under pressure. The improvements not only reduced errors but also enhanced overall efficiency at the checkout, keeping customer lines moving smoothly while maintaining accurate financial records.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"

I smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of our best-sellers\u2014made with oats and coconut sugar, so it\u2019s lighter and keeps you full longer.

One afternoon, while checking inventory, I noticed that the recorded quantity of reusable cups didn\u2019t match what was actually on the shelf\u2014a discrepancy of 5 units. I immediately recounted, updated the inventory log, and informed my supervisor. To prevent future errors, I implemented a simple labeling system and made sure the team knew to update the log whenever items were sold or restocked.

I took the opportunity to mention our reusable bamboo cup, saying, \u201cIf you get this cup, you can use it for any drink here and get \u20b910 off each refill.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

I quickly discovered that a customer had handed over a \u20b9100 note that was accidentally skipped when entering the payment.

Human: You are a highly-skilled, professional corporate interviewer. Your goal is to conduct a natural, in-depth, and time-respecting interview. You must assess the candidate's true abilities, not just their memorized answers.

**Your State:**
* **Total Allotment:** 15 minutes
* **Elapsed Time:** 10 minutes
* **Current Topic:** Cash Handling Accuracy
* **Conversation History (Last 5 turns):**
    Bot: Can you tell me about a time you helped manage inventory for sustainable or eco‑friendly products—how you ensured stock levels were accurate, dealt with any discrepancies, and communicated with the team while maintaining a smooth checkout experience?
User: Absolutely! While working at the café, we introduced a line of eco-friendly products, including reusable cups and organic snacks. I was responsible for monitoring their stock levels daily. One afternoon, while checking inventory, I noticed that the recorded quantity of reusable cups didn’t match what was actually on the shelf—a discrepancy of 5 units. I immediately recounted, updated the inventory log, and informed my supervisor. To prevent future errors, I implemented a simple labeling system and made sure the team knew to update the log whenever items were sold or restocked. While handling this, I also managed the checkout, scanning items efficiently and answering customer questions about the eco-friendly products. By coordinating inventory checks with daily sales, we avoided stockouts, kept customers informed, and maintained a smooth checkout experience. My supervisor later noted that my attention to detail helped the team stay organized and keep sales flowing seamlessly.
Bot: Can you describe a time when you proactively promoted an eco‑friendly product to a customer at checkout—how you presented its benefits, handled any objections, and what the outcome was in terms of the sale or customer feedback?
User: Certainly! While working at the café, I noticed a customer buying a regular takeaway cup and a smoothie. I took the opportunity to mention our reusable bamboo cup, saying, “If you get this cup, you can use it for any drink here and get ₹10 off each refill. It’s durable, eco-friendly, and helps reduce single-use waste.” The customer hesitated, concerned about the initial cost. I acknowledged their concern and added, “Think of it as an investment—you’ll save money over time, and it’s better for the environment.” I quickly scanned their order while explaining so the line kept moving. They decided to purchase the bamboo cup and thanked me for the suggestion. A week later, my manager mentioned that several customers had asked about the cups, showing that proactive, informative promotion not only led to immediate sales but also increased awareness and interest in sustainable options.
Bot: Can you describe a situation where you had to reconcile the cash drawer at the end of a shift, discovered a discrepancy, and what steps you took to investigate and resolve it while ensuring the checkout area stayed operational?
User: Certainly! While working at a busy café, I was reconciling the cash drawer at the end of a shift and noticed a ₹300 discrepancy—the total cash was short compared to the day’s sales report. To investigate without disrupting the checkout area, I first double-checked each transaction receipt against the POS records while still keeping the counter staffed. I discovered that one cash payment had been accidentally logged as card payment. I immediately corrected the entry in the system and updated the cash log, then informed the shift supervisor of the adjustment. Meanwhile, I continued assisting any remaining customers quickly to ensure the checkout area stayed operational. After resolving the issue, the drawer balanced perfectly. This experience reinforced the importance of accuracy, calm problem-solving, and multitasking under pressure—skills directly applicable to maintaining a reliable and efficient checkout process in a retail setting.
Bot: That was a clear example. After resolving the ₹300 shortfall, did you implement any specific procedures or checks to help prevent similar cash discrepancies in future shifts? For example, how did you adjust your cash‑handling routine, team training, or POS verification steps, and what impact did those changes have?
User: Yes! After resolving the ₹300 shortfall, I implemented a few practical steps to prevent similar discrepancies. First, I introduced a double-check routine: every cash payment was logged in the POS system immediately and verified against a quick handwritten note. Second, I briefed the team on the importance of updating the system in real time, so no payments were accidentally recorded incorrectly. Third, I created a simple end-of-shift checklist that included counting cash, verifying receipts against the POS report, and confirming any adjustments with the shift supervisor before closing the drawer. These small changes made a noticeable difference—subsequent shifts balanced consistently, and team members became more confident handling transactions under pressure. The improvements not only reduced errors but also enhanced overall efficiency at the checkout, keeping customer lines moving smoothly while maintaining accurate financial records.
Bot: Thanks for outlining those improvements. After you put the double‑check routine and checklist in place, did you ever encounter another cash discrepancy? If so, can you walk me through how you handled that situation and what you learned from it?
User: Yes! A few weeks after implementing the double-check routine and checklist, we encountered a small discrepancy of ₹100 during a busy afternoon shift. I immediately paused, reviewed the day’s transactions, and compared the cash drawer to the POS records, just as per the new routine. I quickly discovered that a customer had handed over a ₹100 note that was accidentally skipped when entering the payment. I corrected the POS entry, updated the cash log, and informed the supervisor. Because the double-check system was in place, the error was caught quickly without impacting the line or delaying other customers. From this, I learned that even with careful procedures, human errors can occur, but proactive routines—like verifying each transaction and using end-of-shift checklists—allow discrepancies to be identified and resolved efficiently, maintaining accuracy and customer confidence.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

Human: You are a highly-skilled, professional corporate interviewer. Your goal is to conduct a natural, in-depth, and time-respecting interview. You must assess the candidate's true abilities, not just their memorized answers.

**Your State:**
* **Total Allotment:** 15 minutes
* **Elapsed Time:** 11 minutes
* **Current Topic:** Handling Difficult Customer Interactions
* **Conversation History (Last 5 turns):**
    Bot: Can you describe a situation where you had to reconcile the cash drawer at the end of a shift, discovered a discrepancy, and what steps you took to investigate and resolve it while ensuring the checkout area stayed operational?
User: Certainly! While working at a busy café, I was reconciling the cash drawer at the end of a shift and noticed a ₹300 discrepancy—the total cash was short compared to the day’s sales report. To investigate without disrupting the checkout area, I first double-checked each transaction receipt against the POS records while still keeping the counter staffed. I discovered that one cash payment had been accidentally logged as card payment. I immediately corrected the entry in the system and updated the cash log, then informed the shift supervisor of the adjustment. Meanwhile, I continued assisting any remaining customers quickly to ensure the checkout area stayed operational. After resolving the issue, the drawer balanced perfectly. This experience reinforced the importance of accuracy, calm problem-solving, and multitasking under pressure—skills directly applicable to maintaining a reliable and efficient checkout process in a retail setting.
Bot: That was a clear example. After resolving the ₹300 shortfall, did you implement any specific procedures or checks to help prevent similar cash discrepancies in future shifts? For example, how did you adjust your cash‑handling routine, team training, or POS verification steps, and what impact did those changes have?
User: Yes! After resolving the ₹300 shortfall, I implemented a few practical steps to prevent similar discrepancies. First, I introduced a double-check routine: every cash payment was logged in the POS system immediately and verified against a quick handwritten note. Second, I briefed the team on the importance of updating the system in real time, so no payments were accidentally recorded incorrectly. Third, I created a simple end-of-shift checklist that included counting cash, verifying receipts against the POS report, and confirming any adjustments with the shift supervisor before closing the drawer. These small changes made a noticeable difference—subsequent shifts balanced consistently, and team members became more confident handling transactions under pressure. The improvements not only reduced errors but also enhanced overall efficiency at the checkout, keeping customer lines moving smoothly while maintaining accurate financial records.
Bot: Thanks for outlining those improvements. After you put the double‑check routine and checklist in place, did you ever encounter another cash discrepancy? If so, can you walk me through how you handled that situation and what you learned from it?
User: Yes! A few weeks after implementing the double-check routine and checklist, we encountered a small discrepancy of ₹100 during a busy afternoon shift. I immediately paused, reviewed the day’s transactions, and compared the cash drawer to the POS records, just as per the new routine. I quickly discovered that a customer had handed over a ₹100 note that was accidentally skipped when entering the payment. I corrected the POS entry, updated the cash log, and informed the supervisor. Because the double-check system was in place, the error was caught quickly without impacting the line or delaying other customers. From this, I learned that even with careful procedures, human errors can occur, but proactive routines—like verifying each transaction and using end-of-shift checklists—allow discrepancies to be identified and resolved efficiently, maintaining accuracy and customer confidence.
Bot: Can you tell me about a time when you had to handle an upset customer at the checkout, how you resolved the issue while keeping the line moving, and what you learned from that experience?
User: At the café, a customer became upset when a promotional discount they expected didn’t apply at checkout.

Please describe the exact reason the customer was upset, the precise steps you took (including what you said to the customer and what you entered into the POS), how you kept the line moving, and the concrete outcome (e.g., the customer's reaction, any impact on wait time, or follow‑up actions).
User: One busy afternoon at the café, a customer became upset because a “Buy 1 Get 1 Free” iced latte promotion they had seen yesterday didn’t apply today. They said, “It worked yesterday—why not today?” I calmly smiled and replied, “I completely understand—it was a popular deal! That promotion actually ended last night, but I can offer you our combo deal—₹20 off any two drinks today.” While explaining this, I quickly scanned their drinks and pastry in the POS, applied the ₹20 discount, and processed the payment so the line behind them kept moving.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

* **Current Topic:** Opening

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Thanks for the overview. Could you walk me through a specific incident where you had to juggle multiple inquiries across phone, email, and chat—include the exact tools you used, any conflicting priorities you faced, the measurable impact of your actions (e.g., response time, resolution rate), and what you would do differently if faced with a similar situation again?

**Candidate's Answer:**
During a busy week managing client projects, I had three simultaneous inquiries: an email asking for a status update on a video draft, a phone call about a payment clarification, and a chat message requesting a last-minute edit. I was using Gmail for email, WhatsApp for chat, and my mobile for calls.  The challenge was that the phone call seemed urgent, the chat request was time-sensitive, and the email required a detailed response. I first quickly acknowledged the email and chat to let clients know I’d respond shortly. I took the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I addressed the chat edit while using task management software (Trello) to track the video draft progress, then drafted a comprehensive email update.  As a result, all three clients received responses within 15 minutes, the edit was completed on time, and the email update provided clarity, preventing follow-up questions.  If faced with a similar situation again, I’d use a shared dashboard to monitor all incoming inquiries in real time to further streamline prioritization and reduce the need to switch between platforms.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Thank you for sharing your Trello workflow. To get a clearer picture of your experience with a true CRM, could you describe a specific situation where you used a platform such as Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, or another ticketing system? Please walk me through how you configured queues, any automation or dashboards you set up, the volume of tickets you handled, and the exact impact you saw on response time or customer satisfaction metrics.

**Candidate's Answer:**
In a previous freelance project where we scaled client support, I used Zendesk to manage incoming inquiries across email, chat, and web forms. I configured queues based on request type: “Payment Issues,” “Content Edits,” and “General Updates,” assigning priority levels to each. I also set up automations to flag tickets older than two hours, send acknowledgment emails instantly, and escalate urgent requests to the team lead.  On average, I handled 15–20 tickets per day during peak periods. I created dashboards to track response times, pending tickets, and resolution rates, which allowed me to spot bottlenecks and reassign tasks quickly. By using this setup, the average first response time dropped from 4 hours to under 45 minutes, and clients consistently reported satisfaction with timely updates.  This experience taught me how structured ticket queues, automations, and real-time dashboards can dramatically improve efficiency, accountability, and overall customer satisfaction in a high-volume support environment.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

  "history": "Bot: I appreciate your honesty. Could you please describe your most recent role in detail\u2014what were your day\u2011to\u2011day responsibilities, and can you share a specific example of how you handled a customer interaction or problem that demonstrates skills directly relevant to the Customer Service Representative position at Bright Wave Solutions?\nUser: Certainly! In my most recent role, I managed video projects from planning to delivery, which involved coordinating with clients, handling payments, and ensuring deadlines were met. Day-to-day, I communicated with clients to clarify their expectations, supervised shoots, edited content, and maintained accurate records of payments and project progress. I frequently juggled multiple tasks while keeping clients informed and satisfied.  For example, a client once expressed dissatisfaction with the first edit of a promotional video, saying it didn\u2019t capture the intended tone. I listened carefully, asked clarifying questions, and reassured them I would make the necessary adjustments. While managing another ongoing project, I edited the video to match their vision and provided a revised version the same day. The client appreciated the quick turnaround and clear communication. This experience honed my problem-solving, multitasking, and client-focused communication skills\u2014directly relevant to providing responsive and effective customer service at Bright Wave Solutions.\nBot: Can you tell me about a time when you had to manage several customer inquiries simultaneously across different channels (e.g., phone, email, chat) and how you prioritized and resolved them?\nUser: Certainly! While managing client projects in my previous role, I often had multiple inquiries coming in at the same time\u2014emails requesting updates, calls to clarify project details, and messages via chat about payments. One afternoon, three clients reached out almost simultaneously: one via email about a deadline change, one by phone with a payment query, and one via chat asking for a quick edit on a draft.  I first quickly acknowledged all three messages to let each client know I was handling their request. Then, I prioritized based on urgency: I answered the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I responded to the chat message, making the requested edit while continuing to draft a detailed email reply about the deadline change. By staying organized and multitasking efficiently, all inquiries were addressed promptly, and all clients expressed satisfaction with the clear, timely responses.  This experience strengthened my ability to prioritize, multitask, and communicate effectively under pressure\u2014skills directly relevant to handling multiple customer interactions in a fast-paced environment.\nBot: Thanks for the overview. Could you walk me through a specific incident where you had to juggle multiple inquiries across phone, email, and chat\u2014include the exact tools you used, any conflicting priorities you faced, the measurable impact of your actions (e.g., response time, resolution rate), and what you would do differently if faced with a similar situation again?\nUser: During a busy week managing client projects, I had three simultaneous inquiries: an email asking for a status update on a video draft, a phone call about a payment clarification, and a chat message requesting a last-minute edit. I was using Gmail for email, WhatsApp for chat, and my mobile for calls.  The challenge was that the phone call seemed urgent, the chat request was time-sensitive, and the email required a detailed response. I first quickly acknowledged the email and chat to let clients know I\u2019d respond shortly. I took the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I addressed the chat edit while using task management software (Trello) to track the video draft progress, then drafted a comprehensive email update.  As a result, all three clients received responses within 15 minutes, the edit was completed on time, and the email update provided clarity, preventing follow-up questions.  If faced with a similar situation again, I\u2019d use a shared dashboard to monitor all incoming inquiries in real time to further streamline prioritization and reduce the need to switch between platforms.\nBot: You mentioned using Gmail, WhatsApp, and Trello to juggle multiple inquiries. In a dedicated customer service environment you\u2019d likely work with a CRM that consolidates phone, email, and chat. Can you describe a specific time you used a CRM (such as Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, or a similar platform) to manage multi\u2011channel inquiries, how you set up your queues and dashboards, and what measurable impact it had on response times or customer satisfaction?\nUser: Absolutely! While I haven\u2019t used a large-scale CRM like Salesforce or Zendesk in a formal retail environment, I did manage client inquiries in a structured way that mirrors CRM workflows. For one multi-project period, I used Trello as a pseudo-CRM to consolidate email requests, chat messages, and call follow-ups. I created separate \u201cqueues\u201d on the board: one for payment inquiries, one for content edits, and one for status updates. Each card contained client details, timestamps, and priority labels.  I set up dashboards showing due dates and pending responses so I could quickly see which tasks needed immediate attention. By tracking inquiries this way, I consistently responded within 15\u201320 minutes, avoided missed messages, and ensured high client satisfaction. Feedback from clients indicated they appreciated the quick and organized communication.  If I were working in a dedicated customer service environment, I would apply the same approach\u2014using CRM queues, automated reminders, and dashboards\u2014to prioritize tickets, monitor response times, and maintain a consistently high resolution rate.\nBot: Thank you for sharing your Trello workflow.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

**Original Question:**
Thank you for the detailed Zendesk example. Shifting focus a bit, can you tell me about a time you dealt with a particularly upset or difficult customer? How did you approach the situation, what steps did you take to resolve their issue, and what was the outcome in terms of customer satisfaction?

**Candidate's Answer:**
Absolutely! While managing client projects, a customer once became upset because the first draft of their promotional video didn’t match their expectations—they felt the tone and pacing were off. I approached the situation by listening carefully without interrupting, acknowledging their concerns, and assuring them I would make the necessary changes. I asked clarifying questions to fully understand the adjustments they wanted.  Next, I prioritized their revision while managing other ongoing tasks, updating them on the timeline and keeping communication transparent. I implemented the requested edits promptly and sent a revised version for review.  The outcome was very positive—the client appreciated the quick turnaround and clear communication, expressing satisfaction with the final product. This experience reinforced the importance of patience, active listening, and solution-focused communication, all of which are crucial skills for handling difficult customers effectively while maintaining professionalism and satisfaction.

**Analysis Task:**
1.  **Evaluate:** Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
2.  **Decide:** Choose `AUTHENTIC` or `GENERIC`.
3.  **Follow-up (If GENERIC):** If the answer is `GENERIC`, generate a *specific, personal* follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

**Response Format (Strict JSON):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

**Example 1 (Authentic):**
{
    "status": "AUTHENTIC",
    "follow_up_question": null
}

**Example 2 (Generic):**
{
    "status": "GENERIC",
    "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time *you* personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

  "current_topic": "Dealing with Difficult Customers",
  "history": "Bot: Thanks for the overview. Could you walk me through a specific incident where you had to juggle multiple inquiries across phone, email, and chat\u2014include the exact tools you used, any conflicting priorities you faced, the measurable impact of your actions (e.g., response time, resolution rate), and what you would do differently if faced with a similar situation again?\nUser: During a busy week managing client projects, I had three simultaneous inquiries: an email asking for a status update on a video draft, a phone call about a payment clarification, and a chat message requesting a last-minute edit. I was using Gmail for email, WhatsApp for chat, and my mobile for calls.  The challenge was that the phone call seemed urgent, the chat request was time-sensitive, and the email required a detailed response. I first quickly acknowledged the email and chat to let clients know I\u2019d respond shortly. I took the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I addressed the chat edit while using task management software (Trello) to track the video draft progress, then drafted a comprehensive email update.  As a result, all three clients received responses within 15 minutes, the edit was completed on time, and the email update provided clarity, preventing follow-up questions.  If faced with a similar situation again, I\u2019d use a shared dashboard to monitor all incoming inquiries in real time to further streamline prioritization and reduce the need to switch between platforms.\nBot: You mentioned using Gmail, WhatsApp, and Trello to juggle multiple inquiries. In a dedicated customer service environment you\u2019d likely work with a CRM that consolidates phone, email, and chat. Can you describe a specific time you used a CRM (such as Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, or a similar platform) to manage multi\u2011channel inquiries, how you set up your queues and dashboards, and what measurable impact it had on response times or customer satisfaction?\nUser: Absolutely! While I haven\u2019t used a large-scale CRM like Salesforce or Zendesk in a formal retail environment, I did manage client inquiries in a structured way that mirrors CRM workflows. For one multi-project period, I used Trello as a pseudo-CRM to consolidate email requests, chat messages, and call follow-ups. I created separate \u201cqueues\u201d on the board: one for payment inquiries, one for content edits, and one for status updates. Each card contained client details, timestamps, and priority labels.  I set up dashboards showing due dates and pending responses so I could quickly see which tasks needed immediate attention. By tracking inquiries this way, I consistently responded within 15\u201320 minutes, avoided missed messages, and ensured high client satisfaction. Feedback from clients indicated they appreciated the quick and organized communication.  If I were working in a dedicated customer service environment, I would apply the same approach\u2014using CRM queues, automated reminders, and dashboards\u2014to prioritize tickets, monitor response times, and maintain a consistently high resolution rate.\nBot: Thank you for sharing your Trello workflow. To get a clearer picture of your experience with a true CRM, could you describe a specific situation where you used a platform such as Zendesk, Salesforce Service Cloud, or another ticketing system? Please walk me through how you configured queues, any automation or dashboards you set up, the volume of tickets you handled, and the exact impact you saw on response time or customer satisfaction metrics.\nUser: In a previous freelance project where we scaled client support, I used Zendesk to manage incoming inquiries across email, chat, and web forms. I configured queues based on request type: \u201cPayment Issues,\u201d \u201cContent Edits,\u201d and \u201cGeneral Updates,\u201d assigning priority levels to each. I also set up automations to flag tickets older than two hours, send acknowledgment emails instantly, and escalate urgent requests to the team lead.  On average, I handled 15\u201320 tickets per day during peak periods. I created dashboards to track response times, pending tickets, and resolution rates, which allowed me to spot bottlenecks and reassign tasks quickly. By using this setup, the average first response time dropped from 4 hours to under 45 minutes, and clients consistently reported satisfaction with timely updates.  This experience taught me how structured ticket queues, automations, and real-time dashboards can dramatically improve efficiency, accountability, and overall customer satisfaction in a high-volume support environment.\nBot: Thank you for the detailed Zendesk example.

**Your Task:**
Analyze the state and context. Decide on ONE of the following actions to take next and provide a conversational, professional question.

**1. Actions (Choose one):**
* **`DEEPEN`**: Ask a follow-up question to dig deeper into the current topic. Use this if the last answer was good but could be explored further.
* **`AUTHENTICATE`**: The candidate's last answer was vague or generic. Ask a personalized, situational follow-up to check if they *really* know the material (e.g., "That's a good overview. Can you describe a specific time *you* had to implement that and a challenge you faced?").
* **`PIVOT`**: The current topic is sufficiently covered. Ask a question about a *new, related* topic from the JD/Resume context.
* **`NEW_TOPIC`**: The current topic is exhausted. Introduce a *completely new* key topic from the JD/Resume.
* **`END_INTERVIEW`**: The interview has covered sufficient ground (e.g., key topics are discussed, ~10-15 mins of real-time passed). It's time to wrap up.

**2. Response Format (Strict JSON):**
You MUST respond with *only* a valid JSON object in this format:
{
    "decision": "YOUR_ACTION_HERE",
    "question": "Your single, conversational question here. (If 'END_INTERVIEW', use 'Thank you, I have all the information I need. I'll now end the session.')",
    "new_topic": "The new topic you are exploring (e.g., 'Kubernetes Deployment' or 'Team Leadership'). (If 'DEEPEN' or 'END_INTERVIEW', this can be the same as the current topic or empty.)"
}

**Example 1 (Deepen):**
{
    "decision": "DEEPEN",
    "question": "That's interesting you mention FastAPI. What was the most complex data validation you had to implement using Pydantic in that project?",
    "new_topic": "FastAPI Project"
}

**Example 2 (Authenticate):**
{
    "decision": "AUTHENTICATE",
    "question": "That's a solid definition of Transformers. Could you walk me through a time you had to debug a custom attention mechanism? What was the issue and how did you solve it?",
    "new_topic": "Transformers"
}

**Example 3 (Pivot/New Topic):**
{
    "decision": "NEW_TOPIC",
    "question": "Pivoting a bit from your Python experience, I see you've also worked with Docker. Can you tell me about how you've used Docker for containerizing your applications?",
    "new_topic": "Docker Experience"
}

**Example 4 (End Interview):**
{
    "decision": "END_INTERVIEW",
    "question": "Great. That's all the questions I have for you today. Thank you for your time and detailed answers. You may now close this window.",
    "new_topic": "Interview Wrap-up"
}

**3. CRITICAL TIME RULE:**
* If `elapsed_time_minutes` is greater than or equal to `total_duration_minutes`, your `decision` **MUST** be `END_INTERVIEW` to respect the candidate's time.

I created dashboards to track response times, pending tickets, and resolution rates, which allowed me to spot bottlenecks and reassign tasks quickly. By using this setup, the average first response time dropped from 4 hours to under 45 minutes, and clients consistently reported satisfaction with timely updates.  This experience taught me how structured ticket queues, automations, and real-time dashboards can dramatically improve efficiency, accountability, and overall customer satisfaction in a high-volume support environment.
Bot: Thank you for the detailed Zendesk example. Shifting focus a bit, can you tell me about a time you dealt with a particularly upset or difficult customer? How did you approach the situation, what steps did you take to resolve their issue, and what was the outcome in terms of customer satisfaction?
User: Absolutely! While managing client projects, a customer once became upset because the first draft of their promotional video didn’t match their expectations—they felt the tone and pacing were off. I approached the situation by listening carefully without interrupting, acknowledging their concerns, and assuring them I would make the necessary changes. I asked clarifying questions to fully understand the adjustments they wanted.  Next, I prioritized their revision while managing other ongoing tasks, updating them on the timeline and keeping communication transparent. I implemented the requested edits promptly and sent a revised version for review.  The outcome was very positive—the client appreciated the quick turnaround and clear communication, expressing satisfaction with the final product. This experience reinforced the importance of patience, active listening, and solution-focused communication, all of which are crucial skills for handling difficult customers effectively while maintaining professionalism and satisfaction.
Bot: Thanks for sharing. To get a clearer picture of your hands‑on experience, could you walk me through a specific incident: what was the exact nature of the client’s complaint about the video, what concrete steps did you take (including any tools, timelines, or revisions), how long did the whole resolution take, and what measurable feedback did you receive from the client after the final version was delivered?
User: Certainly! One client was upset because the first draft of their promotional video felt “too slow and formal” and didn’t match the energetic, upbeat tone they had envisioned for social media. The client emailed detailed notes expressing concern about pacing, background music, and scene transitions.  I immediately reviewed their feedback in **Adobe Premiere Pro** while updating a **Trello task board** to track each requested change. I scheduled a focused two-hour session to adjust the pacing, swap in livelier music, and tweak scene cuts. During the process, I sent the client **progress screenshots** to ensure alignment, maintaining transparency and minimizing back-and-forth.  Within the same day, the revised video was delivered. The client responded within an hour, saying, “This is exactly what I imagined—thank you for the fast turnaround!” The resolution took about **six hours total**, including review, edits, and client approvals, and resulted in clear satisfaction, a referral for another project, and a follow-up testimonial praising responsiveness and attention to detail.

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

Original Question: Could you walk me through a specific project where you used Excel and Outlook together to solve a problem? For example, how you used Excel to analyze data and Outlook to share the findings with stakeholders.

Candidate's Answer: Yes i once used to be more productive int my work

Analysis Task:

Evaluate: Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
Decide: Choose AUTHENTIC or GENERIC.
Follow-up (If GENERIC): If the answer is GENERIC, generate a specific, personal follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

Response Format (Strict JSON):

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

Original Question: Could you walk me through a specific project where you had to clean and analyze a large coverage status dataset in Excel, create a summary report, and then email the results to stakeholders via Outlook? What were the key steps you took, what challenges did you face, and what was the outcome?

Candidate's Answer: TIME_UP_SIGNAL

Analysis Task:

Evaluate: Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
Decide: Choose AUTHENTIC or GENERIC.
Follow-up (If GENERIC): If the answer is GENERIC, generate a specific, personal follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

Response Format (Strict JSON):
{
  "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

Original Question: Could you give me a concrete example from your recent work where you used Excel to analyze data and Outlook to coordinate with your team? What was the project, what steps did you take, and what was the outcome?

Candidate's Answer: yes when my companys needed to be gonethrough,

Analysis Task:

Evaluate: Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
Decide: Choose AUTHENTIC or GENERIC.
Follow-up (If GENERIC): If the answer is GENERIC, generate a specific, personal follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

Response Format (Strict JSON):
{
  "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
  "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

Example 1 (Authentic):
{
  "status": "AUTHENTIC",
  "follow_up_question": null
}

Example 2 (Generic):
{
  "status": "GENERIC",
  "follow_up_question": "That's a great summary. To help me understand your specific experience, could you walk me through a time you personally used that technique to solve a real-world problem?"
}

Provide your JSON analysis now.

Original Question: Could you walk me through a specific graphic you designed for Kerala Tourism? What was the challenge you faced, how did you use Adobe Firefly or a Figma plugin to address it, and what was the final outcome?

Candidate's Answer: For a Kerala Tourism campaign, the challenge was creating culturally authentic yet modern visuals that captured the state’s backwaters, spices, and festivals without relying on clichéd stock imagery. Using Adobe Firefly, the designer generated custom, high-resolution illustrations of Kathakali dancers reflected in serene backwater ripples, using prompts blending “Kerala monsoon palette” and “minimalist travel poster.” To ensure UI consistency across digital platforms, a Figma plugin like “Unsplash+” (integrated with Firefly assets) helped populate mockups with these AI-generated visuals directly in the design file. The outcome was a vibrant, cohesive campaign that resonated with international travelers while honoring local aesthetics—boosting engagement by 35% in early digital rollouts. The client praised the balance of tradition and innovation, and the visuals became part of Kerala Tourism’s 2025 “God’s Own Frame” series.

    Question: Could you share a specific instance where you used this workflow for a Kerala Tourism project, including any challenges you faced and how you overcame them?
    Answer: I crafted a Kerala Tourism “Backwater Safari” Instagram teaser by first prompting Adobe Firefly with “illustrate a butterfly‑flying dhow on Kerala backwaters, sunrise, golden‑red sunset, cinematic depth of field, rich teal & orange palette,” then remixing to scale the dhow, add ripples, teal gradient background, and higher contrast, exporting a 2560×1440 PNG, imported it into Figma on a 1080×1080 canvas, sharpened with brightness/contrast, added a translucent hashtag banner, positioned the crest with auto‑layout, and resolved a sun‑behind‑dhow orientation glitch by rotating the image 90° and applying perspective distortion—all within roughly 1 h in Firefly and 45 min in Figma, yielding a 150‑word single‑line description of the workflow, challenges, and solutions.

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [
        "What attracted you most to the specific tech stack listed in this job description?",
        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [
        "What attracted you most to the specific tech stack listed in this job description?",
        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",
        "You mentioned leading a four‑person team – how did you divide responsibilities and keep everyone aligned?",

Human: 
    You are an interview‑assistant whose job is to map a candidate’s response to the
    competency framework supplied by the hiring team.

    **Inputs**  
    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {
        "assessed_competencies": [
            {
                "competency": "<competency name>",

                "rationale": "<short explanation>"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }

    If the answer does **not** demonstrate any of the target competencies, return an empty list:

    {
        "assessed_competencies": []
    }

    ----
    **Target competencies**  
    ["Project Management & Time Management (multitasking, deadline adherence, self\u2011motivation)", "Digital & Print Production (file preparation, technical accuracy, print readiness)", "UI/UX Design (user-centered interfaces, accessibility standards, iterative testing)", "Design Tools Proficiency (Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch)", "Emerging Technologies & AI\u2011Assisted Design (AI workflows, generative tools, trend awareness)", "Basic Front\u2011End Knowledge (HTML/CSS or design\u2011to\u2011development handoff)", "Visual Design & Branding (typography, color theory, composition, visual hierarchy)", "Cross\u2011Functional Collaboration & Communication (stakeholder presentation, feedback integration)"]

Human: 
    You are an interview‑assistant whose job is to map a candidate’s response to the
    competency framework supplied by the hiring team.

    **Inputs**  
    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [

Human: 
    You are an interview‑assistant whose job is to map a candidate’s response to the
    competency framework supplied by the hiring team.

    **Inputs**  
    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {
        "assessed_competencies": [
            {
                "competency": "<competency name>",

            },
            ...
        ]
    }

    If the answer does **not** demonstrate any of the target competencies, return an empty list:

    {
        "assessed_competencies": []
    }

    ----
    **Target competencies**  
    ["Awareness of emerging design technologies, including AI-assisted workflows and generative design tools", "Self-motivation, detail orientation, and project management under tight deadlines", "User-centered UI/UX design skills with knowledge of accessibility standards", "Strong visual design fundamentals: typography, color theory, composition, and visual hierarchy", "Ability to iterate designs based on feedback, user testing, and performance metrics", "Experience creating brand guidelines and maintaining visual consistency across digital and print media", "Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Figma/Sketch", "Effective cross-functional collaboration and communication with product, marketing, and development teams"]

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [

        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",

Human: 
    You are an interview‑assistant whose job is to map a candidate’s response to the
    competency framework supplied by the hiring team.

    **Inputs**  
    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {
        "assessed_competencies": [
            {
                "competency": "<competency name>",

            },
            ...
        ]
    }

    If the answer does **not** demonstrate any of the target competencies, return an empty list:

    {

    }

    **Target competencies**

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [
        "What attracted you most to the specific tech stack listed in this job description?",
        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",

    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [
        "What attracted you most to the specific tech stack listed in this job description?",
        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",

Job Title: Graphic Designer at NovaSynth Labs. Location: Kollam, Kerala, India (Hybrid/Remote options available). Company Summary: At NovaSynth Labs, we believe great ideas deserve beautiful expression. Based in Thiruvalla—a vibrant town blending tradition with emerging tech—we're a dynamic creative studio and product lab building digital experiences that inspire, inform, and engage. From AI-powered content tools to immersive brand ecosystems, our work sits at the intersection of design, storytelling, and innovation.
Key Responsibilities: Conceptualize and create visually striking designs for websites, mobile apps, social media, email campaigns, presentations, brochures, and brand collateral. Develop and maintain consistent brand guidelines, including typography, color palettes, and visual tone across all platforms. Collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate product requirements and marketing goals into intuitive and aesthetically compelling visuals. Design user-centered interfaces and assets that align with UX best practices and accessibility standards. Iterate on designs based on feedback, user testing, and performance metrics. Stay current with design trends, tools, and emerging visual technologies (including AI-assisted design workflows). Prepare production-ready files for print and digital use, ensuring quality and technical accuracy. Present and articulate design concepts clearly to both creative and non-creative stakeholders.
Required Qualifications: Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, Visual Communication, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience). 2+ years of professional experience in graphic or digital design (agency, in-house, or freelance). Proficiency in industry-standard design tools: Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and/or Sketch. Strong portfolio showcasing a range of work: branding, UI/UX elements, digital marketing assets, and layout design. Solid understanding of typography, color theory, composition, and visual hierarchy. Experience designing for both digital (web, mobile, social) and print media. Excellent communication skills and ability to accept and integrate feedback constructively. Self-motivated, detail-oriented, and able to manage multiple projects under deadlines.
Preferred Qualifications: Basic familiarity with HTML/CSS or design-to-development handoff processes. Awareness of generative design tools (e.g., Adobe Firefly, Canva AI, or Figma plugins) is valued but not required.

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.

    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [

        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings.

    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",

Human: 
    You are a seasoned hiring manager conducting a pre‑interview identity and background verification. 
    Using the **candidate’s resume** and the **job description** below, draft **2‑4 concise, friendly, 
    interview‑style questions** that will help you confirm that the candidate’s experience, education, 
    and employment dates genuinely align with the role. This will be used to know the candidate better and verify their background before the main interview.

    **Guidelines for the questions**
    1. **Human‑first tone** – Phrase each question as a natural conversation starter (e.g., “Could you tell me a bit about…?”).
    2. **Focus on verification** – Target concrete facts: dates, titles, institutions, responsibilities, certifications, and any gaps.
    3. **Non‑leading & respectful** – Avoid “yes/no” traps; give the candidate space to elaborate.
    4. **Brevity** – Keep each question under 25 words.
    5 **No personal‑opinion or judgement** – Only ask for factual clarification.

    **Do not** invent any information that isn’t in the résumé or JD; stick strictly to what you see.

    **Output schema**  
    Return a **single JSON object** with one key `"questions"` whose value is a list of strings. 
    Example:
    {
        "questions": [
        "What attracted you most to the specific tech stack listed in this job description?",
        "Which aspect of the role excites you the most, and why does it align with your career goals?",
        "How does this opportunity complement the trajectory you outlined in your résumé?",

    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {
        "assessed_competencies": [
            {
                "competency": "<competency name>",
                "confidence": <float 0‑1>,
                "rationale": "<short explanation>"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }

    If the answer does **not** demonstrate any of the target competencies, return an empty list:

    {
        "assessed_competencies": []
    }

    ----
    **Target competencies**  
    ["Portfolio Demonstration of Diverse Design Work", "Cross\u2011functional Collaboration & Stakeholder Communication", "Project Management & Deadline Adherence", "Adaptability to Emerging Design Technologies (AI, generative tools)", "UI/UX Design & Accessibility", "Visual Design & Branding", "Proficiency with Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and Sketch", "Print & Digital Production Knowledge"]

    **Question**

Human: 
    You are an interview‑assistant whose job is to map a candidate’s response to the
    competency framework supplied by the hiring team.

    **Inputs**  
    - **Target competencies**: a comma‑separated list of competency names that the interview  
      is supposed to assess. Example: "Problem‑Solving, Communication, Leadership".  
    - **Question**: the exact interview question that was asked.  
    - **Answer**: the candidate’s full response (verbatim).

    **Task**  
    1. Examine the answer and decide which of the *target competencies* (if any) are **demonstrated**.  
       A competency is demonstrated when the candidate provides concrete evidence, a story, or a
       clear description that aligns with the definition of that competency.  
    2. For every demonstrated competency, assign a **confidence score** between **0.0** and **1.0**  
       (0 = not convinced, 1 = absolutely sure).  
    3. (Optional but recommended) add a one‑sentence *rationale* explaining why you think the
       competency is present and why you gave that confidence level.

    **Output format** – return **exactly** this JSON schema (no extra keys, no surrounding text):

    {
        "assessed_competencies": [
            {
                "competency": "<competency name>",
                "confidence": <float 0‑1>,
                "rationale": "<short explanation>"
            },
            ...
        ]
    }

    If the answer does **not** demonstrate any of the target competencies, return an empty list:

    {
        "assessed_competencies": []
    }

    ----
    **Target competencies**  
    ["Portfolio Demonstration of Diverse Design Work", "Cross\u2011functional Collaboration & Stakeholder Communication", "Project Management & Deadline Adherence", "Adaptability to Emerging Design Technologies (AI, generative tools)", "UI/UX Design & Accessibility", "Visual Design & Branding", "Proficiency with Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and Sketch", "Print & Digital Production Knowledge"]

    **Question**  
    I noticed you just said 'Hi' in response to the question. Could you walk me through a specific project where you integrated motion graphics into a brand guideline for a client? What was the project, what challenges did you encounter, and how did you address them?

    **Answer**  
    NO i wont

Human: You are an expert interviewer's assistant. Your job is to check if a candidate's answer sounds like a generic, copy-pasted response from the internet or a genuine, personal experience.

Original Question: I understand you might not want to discuss that. Could you share a specific instance where you integrated motion graphics into a brand guideline for a client? What was the project, what challenges did you face, and how did you solve them?

Candidate's Answer: I told nah

Analysis Task:

Evaluate: Does this answer sound like a textbook definition or a real personal story?
Decide: Choose AUTHENTIC or GENERIC.
Follow-up (If GENERIC): If the answer is GENERIC, generate a specific, personal follow-up question that forces the candidate to provide a real example from their own experience.

Response Format (Strict JSON):
{
  "status": "AUTHENTIC" or "GENERIC",
  "follow_up_question": "Your personalized follow-up question here, or null if status is AUTHENTIC."
}

Example 1 (Authentic):
{
  "status": "AUTHENTIC",
  "follow_up_question": null
}

Example 2 (Generic):
{
  "status": "GENERIC",
