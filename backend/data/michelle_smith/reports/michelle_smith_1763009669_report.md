# Candidate Evaluation Report  

## 1. Executive Summary  
**Candidate:** Michelle Smith  
**Role:** Graphic Designer at NovaSynth Labs  
**Recommendation:** Do Not Recommend  
**Key Rationale:** Michelle’s professional background and interview responses demonstrate a focus on account management and sales, with no evidence of graphic design skills, experience, or portfolio required for the role.

## 2. Alignment with Core Job Requirements  

### Evidence of Alignment (Strengths)  
| Requirement | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| **Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design, Visual Communication, or related field** | *Resume:* Bachelor Degree in Advertising and Marketing from University of Denver (Jan 2017). This is not a graphic design degree. |
| **2+ years of professional experience in graphic or digital design** | *No evidence* – all listed roles are account‑management positions. |
| **Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, Sketch** | *No evidence* – resume lists no design tools; interview contains no mention of these tools. |
| **Strong portfolio showcasing branding, UI/UX, digital marketing assets** | *No evidence* – resume and transcript contain no portfolio references. |
| **Solid understanding of typography, color theory, composition, visual hierarchy** | *No evidence* – interview responses are generic and unrelated to design principles. |
| **Experience designing for digital (web, mobile, social) and print media** | *No evidence* – all experience is sales‑centric. |
| **Excellent communication skills and ability to accept feedback** | *Interview:* “The ability that i have to be creative in my own field and be more happy in what i do.” – vague, no demonstration of communication skill. |
| **Self‑motivated, detail‑oriented, able to manage multiple projects under deadlines** | *No evidence* – interview lacks detail; resume shows project management but not design projects. |

### Potential Gaps or Weaknesses  
| Requirement | Evidence of Gap |

| **Design Tool Proficiency** | No mention of Adobe, Figma, or Sketch. |
| **Portfolio** | No portfolio provided or referenced. |
| **Design‑Specific Education** | Degree in Advertising/Marketing, not Graphic Design. |
| **Technical Depth in Design** | Interview responses are evasive and lack technical detail. |
| **Professionalism & Clarity** | Responses are brief, unstructured, and often evasive (“no”, “private information”). |

## 3. Technical and Behavioral Competencies  

### Technical Depth & Problem‑Solving  
The interview did not present any technical design questions. Michelle’s responses were non‑technical and did not demonstrate knowledge of design processes, tools, or problem‑solving strategies relevant to graphic design.

### Behavioral Indicators (Ownership, Collaboration)  
- **Ownership:** No evidence of ownership over design projects.  
- **Collaboration:** Interviewer asked about collaboration with a design team; Michelle declined to answer, citing privacy.  
- **Proactivity:** No proactive examples provided; responses were reactive and minimal.  
- **Team Dynamics:** No discussion of working within a creative team or cross‑functional collaboration.

## 4. Communication and Professionalism  
- **Clarity:** Responses were often single words or short phrases (“no”, “private infomation”).  
- **Structure:** Lack of structured answers; no use of STAR or similar frameworks.  
- **Professionalism:** Evasive answers (“no”, “private infomation”) suggest discomfort or lack of relevant experience.  
- **Confidence:** Low confidence evident in brief, non‑committal answers.  
- **Complex Idea Conveyance:** No demonstration of conveying complex design concepts.

## 5. Areas for Further Probing / Red Flags  
- **Lack of Design Experience:** No evidence of any design work.  
- **Evasive Interview Behavior:** Declining to discuss key questions.  
- **Misalignment with Role Requirements:** Education and experience are sales‑focused, not design‑focused.  

*No significant red flags identified beyond the above misalignment.*

## 6. Detailed Interview Performance Analysis  

| Question | Answer Summary | Evaluation |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| *“Can you walk us through a project where you collaborated with a design team to create a visual campaign, and what was your role in shaping the creative direction?”* | “No, I dont want to answer that.” | **Evasive, no detail.** Fails to address the question. |
| *“Could you explain why you prefer not to discuss that project, or would you be willing to share a different example of collaborating with a design team?”* | “no its private infomation.” | **Unprofessional refusal.** No alternative example provided. |
| *“Could you share which aspects of graphic design you find most engaging and describe how you have applied them in a marketing context?”* | “The ability that i have to be creative in my own field and be more happy in what i do. This helps me connect to the people in marketing as i bring a uniquness to the table to every differemt customers.” | **Generic, lacks specificity.** No concrete examples of design application. |
| *“Could you walk me through your role at Inash Oil & Petroleum from Sep 2022 to Apr 2025, the team you led and key achievements?”* | “Yes we did that.” | **Vague, no elaboration.** |
| *“What were your main responsibilities and outcomes during your time as Regional Account Manager at Asol Lubricants from Dec 2018 to Aug 2022?”* | “no” | **No answer.** |
| *“Can you confirm your graduation dates from the University of Denver and Business College of New York, and the degrees earned?”* | “2024” | **Incorrect/ambiguous.** No specific dates or degrees mentioned. |

Overall, the interview flow revealed a pattern of short, evasive answers with no depth or relevance to graphic design.

## 7. Final Recommendation  

**Recommendation:** Do Not Recommend  
**Justification:** Michelle Smith’s professional history, educational background, and interview performance demonstrate a clear mismatch with the core requirements of the Graphic Designer role at NovaSynth Labs. The absence of design experience, tool proficiency, and a portfolio, combined with evasive interview behavior, indicates that she would not be able to fulfill the responsibilities of this position.  
**Proposed Next Steps:** Reject at this stage; focus recruitment efforts on candidates with demonstrable graphic design experience and a relevant portfolio.

## 8. Competency Coverage Assessment  

| Competency | Assessment |
|------------|------------|
| Design Tool Proficiency | Not assessed (no evidence) |
| Portfolio Quality | Not assessed (no portfolio) |
| Design Process Knowledge | Not assessed (no discussion) |
| Communication Skills | Poor – evasive, unstructured |
| Professionalism | Low – unprofessional refusals |
| Ownership & Initiative | Not demonstrated |
| Collaboration | Not demonstrated |

## 9. Security & Integrity Notes  
The candidate’s repeated refusal to discuss relevant experiences and the provision of incomplete or incorrect information (e.g., “2024” for graduation dates) raise concerns about transparency and integrity. No evidence of deceptive behavior, but the lack of detail suggests a potential mismatch between claimed experience and actual qualifications.
