## 3. Areas for Development / Concerns
* **Initial Vague Responses** – Early answers such as “Yes i do it in a proper way” and “I use them in day‑to‑day tasks and keep my self updated on it” lacked specificity.  
* **Limited Detail on Non‑AI Tool Usage** – While Adobe Creative Suite is listed in skills, the transcript focuses almost exclusively on Firefly and Figma; no concrete examples of Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign usage were provided during the interview.

## 6. Detailed Interview Analysis
The interview began with a high‑level overview of a recent brand‑guideline project, where Alexandra succinctly described the scope, tools, and impact. Her first few responses were brief and lacked depth, but as the conversation progressed into deeper, scenario‑based questions, she consistently provided concrete, step‑by‑step explanations of her workflow—especially around AI‑assisted design. She demonstrated the ability to pivot quickly when faced with last‑minute client changes (e.g., the “Book in the next 24 h” CTA), showcasing problem‑solving under pressure. The answers were authentic, with specific prompts, file formats, and time estimates, indicating real hands‑on experience. The interview difficulty increased from general project description to detailed tool usage and workflow optimization, and Alexandra maintained clarity and depth throughout.
