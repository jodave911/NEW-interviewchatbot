Using Adobe Firefly, the designer generated custom, high-resolution illustrations of Kathakali dancers reflected in serene backwater ripples, using prompts blending \u201cKerala monsoon palette\u201d and \u201cminimalist travel poster.\u201d To ensure UI consistency across digital platforms, a Figma plugin like \u201cUnsplash+\u201d (integrated with Firefly assets) helped populate mockups with these AI-generated visuals directly in the design file. The outcome was a vibrant, cohesive campaign that resonated with international travelers while honoring local aesthetics\u2014boosting engagement by 35% in early digital rollouts. The client praised the balance of tradition and innovation, and the visuals became part of Kerala Tourism\u2019s 2025 \u201cGod\u2019s Own Frame\u201d series."

In Premiere, I re\u2011sequenced the frames to keep the narrative tight: sunrise bloom (4\u202fs), dhow glide (4\u202fs), timer countdown + CTA (4\u202fs). The updated reel was delivered within the new deadline, meeting the urgency objective while keeping visual quality intact."
