In my most recent role, I managed video projects from planning to delivery, which involved coordinating with clients, handling payments, and ensuring deadlines were met. Day-to-day, I communicated with clients to clarify their expectations, supervised shoots, edited content, and maintained accurate records of payments and project progress. I frequently juggled multiple tasks while keeping clients informed and satisfied.  For example, a client once expressed dissatisfaction with the first edit of a promotional video, saying it didn\u2019t capture the intended tone. I listened carefully, asked clarifying questions, and reassured them I would make the necessary adjustments. While managing another ongoing project, I edited the video to match their vision and provided a revised version the same day. The client appreciated the quick turnaround and clear communication. This experience honed my problem-solving, multitasking, and client-focused communication skills\u2014directly relevant to providing responsive and effective customer service at Bright Wave Solutions."

While managing client projects in my previous role, I often had multiple inquiries coming in at the same time\u2014emails requesting updates, calls to clarify project details, and messages via chat about payments. One afternoon, three clients reached out almost simultaneously: one via email about a deadline change, one by phone with a payment query, and one via chat asking for a quick edit on a draft.  I first quickly acknowledged all three messages to let each client know I was handling their request. Then, I prioritized based on urgency: I answered the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I responded to the chat message, making the requested edit while continuing to draft a detailed email reply about the deadline change. By staying organized and multitasking efficiently, all inquiries were addressed promptly, and all clients expressed satisfaction with the clear, timely responses.  This experience strengthened my ability to prioritize, multitask, and communicate effectively under pressure\u2014skills directly relevant to handling multiple customer interactions in a fast-paced environment."

        "content": "During a busy week managing client projects, I had three simultaneous inquiries: an email asking for a status update on a video draft, a phone call about a payment clarification, and a chat message requesting a last-minute edit. I was using Gmail for email, WhatsApp for chat, and my mobile for calls.  The challenge was that the phone call seemed urgent, the chat request was time-sensitive, and the email required a detailed response. I first quickly acknowledged the email and chat to let clients know I\u2019d respond shortly. I took the phone call immediately, resolving the payment issue in under five minutes. Next, I addressed the chat edit while using task management software (Trello) to track the video draft progress, then drafted a comprehensive email update.  As a result, all three clients received responses within 15 minutes, the edit was completed on time, and the email update provided clarity, preventing follow-up questions.  If faced with a similar situation again, I\u2019d use a shared dashboard to monitor all incoming inquiries in real time to further streamline prioritization and reduce the need to switch between platforms."

While I haven\u2019t used a large-scale CRM like Salesforce or Zendesk in a formal retail environment, I did manage client inquiries in a structured way that mirrors CRM workflows. For one multi-project period, I used Trello as a pseudo-CRM to consolidate email requests, chat messages, and call follow-ups. I created separate \u201cqueues\u201d on the board: one for payment inquiries, one for content edits, and one for status updates. Each card contained client details, timestamps, and priority labels.  I set up dashboards showing due dates and pending responses so I could quickly see which tasks needed immediate attention. By tracking inquiries this way, I consistently responded within 15\u201320 minutes, avoided missed messages, and ensured high client satisfaction. Feedback from clients indicated they appreciated the quick and organized communication.  If I were working in a dedicated customer service environment, I would apply the same approach\u2014using CRM queues, automated reminders, and dashboards\u2014to prioritize tickets, monitor response times, and maintain a consistently high resolution rate."

I configured queues based on request type: \u201cPayment Issues,\u201d \u201cContent Edits,\u201d and \u201cGeneral Updates,\u201d assigning priority levels to each. I also set up automations to flag tickets older than two hours, send acknowledgment emails instantly, and escalate urgent requests to the team lead.  On average, I handled 15\u201320 tickets per day during peak periods. I created dashboards to track response times, pending tickets, and resolution rates, which allowed me to spot bottlenecks and reassign tasks quickly. By using this setup, the average first response time dropped from 4 hours to under 45 minutes, and clients consistently reported satisfaction with timely updates.  This experience taught me how structured ticket queues, automations, and real-time dashboards can dramatically improve efficiency, accountability, and overall customer satisfaction in a high-volume support environment."
