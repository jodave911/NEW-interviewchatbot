* **Potential lack of hands‑on experience** with office‑administration tasks required for the role.

## 6. Detailed Interview Analysis
The interview began with a brief introduction and a series of competency questions. The candidate consistently failed to answer the questions directly:

1. **Education & Experience** – The candidate denied holding the required degree and inventory‑management experience without offering alternative qualifications.  
2. **MS Office Proficiency** – While the candidate claimed a 10/10 proficiency, they could not provide any specific project or task that demonstrated this skill.  
3. **Deep‑Dive Questions** – Repeated attempts to skip or deflect (“I want to skip”, “skip”) and nonsensical statements (“I walkerd 10 stepts to see my visual code”) indicated a lack of preparedness and inability to articulate relevant experience.  
4. **Progressive Difficulty** – As the bot escalated the depth of the questions, the candidate’s responses became increasingly vague, showing no capacity to elaborate or provide evidence.

Overall, the interview flow was ineffective; the candidate did not demonstrate authenticity, depth, or relevance to the Office Manager role.

## 7. Competency Coverage Assessment
| Competency | Interview Coverage | Candidate Performance |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Education** | Asked directly | **No** |
| **Inventory Management** | Asked directly | **No** |
| **MS Excel & Outlook** | Asked for proficiency and examples | **Self‑rated high, no evidence** |
| **Time Management & Multitasking** | Not explicitly asked | **Unverified** |
| **HR Support & Onboarding** | Not asked | **Unverified** |
| **Correspondence & Complaint Handling** | Not asked | **Unverified** |
| **Vendor Liaison** | Not asked | **Unverified** |

The candidate was only able to address the MS Office proficiency question superficially; all other competencies were either unverified or not demonstrated.

---

## 8. Security & Integrity Notes
* The candidate repeatedly requested to skip questions and provided incomplete or nonsensical responses, which may indicate a lack of engagement or potential integrity concerns.  
* No evidence of dishonesty was observed, but the pattern of avoidance suggests the candidate may not be forthcoming or prepared for a role that requires detailed, transparent communication.
