# Candidate Evaluation Report

## 1. Executive Summary
Alexandra Menon is being evaluated for the role of **Graphic Designer** at NovaSynth Labs.  
Alexandra brings 15+ years of senior design experience, a proven track record in building cohesive visual identities for AI‑powered platforms, and a strong portfolio of branding, UI/UX, and print work. While her résumé demonstrates deep expertise in design systems, cross‑platform consistency, and AI‑assisted workflows, the interview transcript provides no substantive evidence of her communication style, technical depth, or problem‑solving approach.  
**Recommendation:** Recommend with Reservations.  
**Key Rationale:** Alexandra’s extensive experience aligns well with the core responsibilities, but the absence of interview data necessitates further probing before a definitive hiring decision.

---

## 5. Areas for Further Probing / Red Flags
- **Missing interview response**: Need to assess communication skills and technical depth.
- **Degree not listed**: Verify educational background.
- **Sketch not mentioned**: Confirm proficiency if required.
- **Portfolio link absent**: Request portfolio for visual assessment.

## 7. Final Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Recommend with Reservations  
**Justification:** Alexandra’s résumé demonstrates strong alignment with the role’s core responsibilities—particularly in design systems, cross‑platform consistency, and AI‑assisted workflows. However, the lack of interview data prevents a full assessment of her communication, problem‑solving, and collaboration skills, which are critical for success in a hybrid/remote environment.  
**Proposed Next Steps:**  
1. Conduct a second interview focused on technical depth (design system implementation, AI tool usage) and communication (case study walk‑through).  
2. Request a portfolio link and verify educational background.  
3. If the follow‑up interview confirms strong communication and technical fit, proceed to final round with the design lead.
